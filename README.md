If you're interested in terrain generation through Perlin Noise on GPU (and a ton of other stuff) I recomend to get a look in Federico Vaccaro's [TerrainEngine-OpenGL](https://github.com/fede-vaccaro/TerrainEngine-OpenGL), it's a hell of a code. You're still here?!?

However, if you prefer to generate a height map via CPU you might be interested in a little code of mine, check out [heightMapThread](https://github.com/MAPSWorks/TessellatedLandscapeOpenGL/blob/master/TessellatedLandscape_OpenGL/heightMapThread.h) class.
